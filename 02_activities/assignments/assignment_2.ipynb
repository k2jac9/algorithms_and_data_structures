    "This assignment was a valuable learning experience. At first, understanding how to traverse a binary tree was challenging, but breaking the problem into steps made it easier. Using Depth First Search (DFS) felt natural because it allowed me to explore each path step by step before going back. Writing examples helped me think about different cases and tree structures.  \n",

Explaining time and space complexity during the review also deepened my understanding of these concepts.

While DFS works well for recursion, BFS is useful for looking at each level of the tree before moving to the next.  \n",

It helped me improve problem-solving, communication, and coding skills, which are all important for technical interviews and real-world programming.
